# Blum Auto Farm
**Blum Auto Farm** is an app designed for point-of-sale farming. It's not just a clicker that you might have seen on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram that simply clicks on a flower with your mouse. This app uses the game's API and sends the server the average number of points you could earn.

## How is this program better than a clicker? 
Oh, this is my favorite part. Imagine that you have 200 tickets and a game lasts 30+ seconds. So to play all these 200 games, we need 6000 seconds or 100 minutes. This is too long. What makes my program stand out is that it starts all the games and after 30+ seconds, it finishes them, and you get the entire reward in just 30 seconds, not 100 minutes, but 30 seconds. That's incredible! This is only available in the Extreme version, because the simple version just plays each game for 30 seconds.

## Can I get a ban for this? 
This is a very interesting question. If you think simply, you can get banned for any cheat. But here, if you think deeper, the program simply sends information to the server that you played and got points for the game. I looked into their code and saw that the game only checks that the player has been playing for more than 30 seconds, and that's it. Therefore, in my opinion, a ban is unlikely.

## Why is the program not free? 
You know, if you worked for nothing, you wouldn't be able to buy food for yourself. That's why my program is not free, so that I can eat too, and for you, it is an investment in time - the faster you play, the more you will get in the future.
